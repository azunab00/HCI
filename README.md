This is the first React.js application I've created as a part of a college project.
The main idea here is to give user all necessary information about libraries in Split, Solin, Ka≈°tela and Trogir in one place.
The information include main library description, library location, address, phone number as well as library location.
The user can also search books, check their availability and view all important information about it.
How many times does it happen that a user forgets to return the book in the proper library? This application lets user view all borrowed books, 
when and where to return them.

This is just a frontend part, with some functionalities implemented.
